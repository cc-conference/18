	<p>
	  The International Conference on Compiler Construction (CC) is interested in work on processing programs in the most general sense: analyzing, transforming or executing input that describes how a system operates, including traditional compiler construction as a special case.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Original contributions are solicited on the topics of interest which include, but are not limited to:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Compilation and interpretation techniques, including program representation, analysis, and transformation; code generation, optimization, and synthesis; the verification thereof
            </li>
            <li>
              Run-time techniques, including memory management, virtual machines, and dynamic and just-in-time compilation
            </li>
            <li>
              Programming tools, including refactoring editors, checkers, verifiers, compilers, debuggers, and profilers
            </li>
            <li>
              Techniques for specific domains, such as secure, parallel, distributed, embedded or mobile environments
            </li>
            <li>
              Design and implementation of novel language constructs, programming models, and domain-specific languages
            </li>
          </ul>
	</p>

	<p>
	  CC 2018 is the 27th edition of the conference. It will be co-located with CGO, HPCA, and PPoPP and take place during 24-25 February in Vienna, Austria.
	</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>

	<p>
	  Papers should be submitted electronically via hotCRP.
	  Papers must be written in English and submitted in PDF in <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM SIGPLAN proceedings format</a>, using the 10pt font size.
	  For LaTeX users, in particular, please use the conference format described in sample-sigplan.tex to format your papers:
	  <pre>\documentclass[sigplan, anonymous, review]{acmart}</pre>
	  The "sigplan" option selects the proceedings format for SIGPLAN conferences, using the default 10pt font size.
	  The "anonymous" option is used for double-blind reviewing.
	  In addition, you are also recommended but not required to use the "review" option, which adds line numbers on the side, thereby allowing reviewers to refer to specific lines in their comments.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library and will be made available freely for the period around the conference.	  
	</p>

	<p>
	  Both regular papers (up to 11 pages) and tool papers (up to 5 pages) are invited. In tool papers, the first part (2 pages) should describe the tool and the second part (about 3 pages) explain the contents of the demo that will be presented with examples and screenshots.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Submissions must adhere strictly to the page limits, including bibliography, figures, or appendices. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version (listings, data, proofs) may be included in a clearly marked appendix. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not be submitted for publication elsewhere. A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation.
	</p>
